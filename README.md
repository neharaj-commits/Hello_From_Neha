# Hello_From_Neha

## Hi everyone!

My name is Neha Rajagopalan. I'm a first year **Ph.D student** in the [Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/) with a specialization in _Developmental Psychological Sciences and Learning Sciences Technology Design (DAPS + LSTD)_. I also have an interest in studying music using Electroencephalograms (EEG) and love to ponder on questions involving perception and learning in the presence of music.

This is a repository created as part of Problem Set 1 for **PSYCH 251: Experimental Methods** taught by[ Michael Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/).
